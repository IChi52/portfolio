### js Files
*parameters* : Contains paramter for the project to run on.
*function* : contains methods that would be used univerally.
*bar_functions* : Contains for creating bar chart.
*pie_functoin.js* : Contains functions for creating pie chart.
*pyramid_functions.js* : Contians functions for creating pyramid graph.

### Thing to mention
The iteraction of clicking graph would apply filter on two other data. If clicked on filtred data(for example, clicking pie chart then click bar chart), it would apply both filter. 
When clicking on *pyramid graph* and apply another filter, it's normal when pyramid disappear because that there is only one sex and age in the same time which is not enough to form pyramid graph.
*Reset* button would reload the data and reinitialze the graph
